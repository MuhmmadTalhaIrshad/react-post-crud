      "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is a client-side JavaScript library it helps us write client-side JavaScript code and itâ€™s all about building modern reactive user interfaces for websites. It makes building a modern, rich, complex user interface easier and it does so, by giving us a higher-level syntax, where we write code in a declarative way, in a declarative component-focused way, we define what we wanna have on the screen, what the end goal is we create these custom HTML elements and React will do the rest. React allows you to create **reusable** and **reactive components** consisting of **HTML** and **JavaScript** (and **CSS**).",
